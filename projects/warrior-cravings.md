summary: An app I created for a group project in 314 that allows students to see the food vendors and menu items available on campus. 
---

Warrior Cravings is a web application that I worked on as a group project for software engineering course (ICS 314) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa campus offers a large selection of food places for students to enjoy and eat at. This app was created with a purpose to allow students to see all the unique food choices available on campus while providing a platform for Vendors to showcase their menu.

While developing the app with project teammates, Jase Ishimi, Louie Bala, Mahie Crabbe, and Zachary Chaikin, I contributed to the team by improving the landing page, making the map page that shows the locations of the vendors, listing the vendors and linking them to the individual sites, updating menu items and updating our homepage and keeping track of development.

This was my first group project that involved coding. I learned the importance of working as a team and communication. Also more about project management, for this project we used something called, Issue Driven Project Management. This way of managing was very helpful since we could keep track of what needed to be done and who would be focusing on each task. 

I also learned that not everything we planned will all be implemented on time. We had a lot of features we wanted to implement, but since this is the first time for most of us, it was hard to figure out how to implement certain features. We wanted to implement a filter, like, and top choices features but we had to hold off on those due to time constraints. I was in charge of figuring out the filter system, but I ran into difficulties with implementing the radio fields and filtering exactly based on certain menu items and vendors. 

Overall, coping with all of the difficulties and trying to find solutions to any errors we came across definitely helped me to gain more experience and knowledge. I got to learn and try many things I never knew we could do, and personalize what we learned in our own web application.
