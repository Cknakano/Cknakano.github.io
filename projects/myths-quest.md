summary: A interactive game I made in High School for fun.

This interactive game was built using Python on a site called repl. I got the idea for this game based on the Netflix series, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. The concept was that the choices you make at certain points in the story, affects the ending. You are making your own adventure. 

In my interactive game, which I called "Myth's Quest," you have to successfully find the 3 artifacts to open the portal to return home. I started off by making a diagram of all the choices you could make and what each choice led to. The diagram helped me to keep track where I was when I was coding the game. It took me about a week to finish the entire game, and at that time was my longest project I worked on. The game has 5 different endings:<br> 1) Successfully retrieve all artifacts to open the portal back home and both worlds remain in peace.<br> 2) Fail, get caught by officers, and you die.<br> 3) Succeed, but the Young Threats also successfully took over the kingdom, which makes life harder for the citizens.<br> 4) Chose the wrong artifact, died by an explosion.<br> 5) Failed to collect all 3 artifacts.<br>

The process of creating the game was a long road but very rewarding. I was able to learn how to allow the players to enter in their own name and gender, and let that be used accordingly in the rest of the storyline. There was a lot of typing and it was hard to come up with a fitting story at first but once the game was complete, I knew that this game was one that I put my best effort into. Looking back, there were many things I could have fixed up or improved on. If I ever get the chance to remake an interactive game, I have a lot of new ideas and concepts.
