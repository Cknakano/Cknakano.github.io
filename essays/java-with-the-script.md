## Inspiration Point

Javascript was one of the first languages I learned when I first started programming. I can say that Javascript was one of the reasons I took up programming which started my interest in a career revolving around computer science. Although I was first introduced to block-based coding, I did not like how I was limited to the certain commands already on the blocks and not knowing correct syntax that would be needed for text-based coding. I decided to learn a language related to developing websites so I came across Javascript. Javascript opened my world to text-based programming which led me to join the robotics team in elementary school. In robotics, I learned the C++ programming language. I also came across Java and Python in other STEM- related classes. In my senior year of high school, I got the chance to use Javascript again when I was developing my github webpage. Taking the Javascript class in my senior year helped me to decide that I would fully major in computer science.

## Improving Javascript Skills

Re-learning the basics of Javascript was fun and it reminded me of the similarities and differences between all the languages I know. After not touching Javascript for a few years, it was great to review the basics and practice my skills. Compared to a lot of the other programming languages I used, Javascript does not use pointers so it is an interesting language to work with. I did not really know about ES6 before doing the modules, so I learned some new ideas and it boosted my experience with Javascript. Doing the practices also reminded me how in-depth Javascript can be and that it is a good tool/language to have. Whether Javascript is a good programming language or not, I believe that it depends on each personâ€™s perspective and preferences.
